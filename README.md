# Project idea:

Flutter Hackaton repository for Blue Earth team's project.

Would allow people to take pictures of a place that has waste thrown out in the open,  and it can also be used if waste bins or stuff like that are needed in an area. Once the pictures are taken, they will be saved and the concerned authorities will be notified from the app. A live update of the issue will be there on the app, the user can have check if the issue is resolved (optional).

- a DB of waste around even helps cleanup crew
- we can also gamify that experience to get points for submitting a picture and also points for cleaning up (rewards)
- if the authorities find who thrown this trash and get fine - get a bounty (free coffe, icecream, at local business)
- yes, we can add on features like the gamify, coupons after initial work
- make picture of mess and clean up picture to get the additional reward
